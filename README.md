# CIS 1500 Class
CIS 1500 is a Java based programming class. In this course, I will learn the fundamentals of computer science through Java programming. We'll cover core concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, and object-oriented programming (OOP), including classes, and inheritance. I’ll gain hands-on experience writing, testing, and debugging Java code through various projects and problem-solving labs.
# Why I Am Taking This Class
Most of my classes so far have focused on programming with Python, which is great since it’s widely used across many industries. However, my goal is to build a broad skill set in both hardware and software, and that includes learning and mastering as many programming languages as I can. Taking this Java-focused course will expanded my knowledge and help me grow further in my academic journey.
